	Protocoll for extracting gold- and silver-standard datasets from DIP, MINT, Intact and Biogrid

Remember to create indexes for the SQLtables and to modify the SQL settings in the scripts (port, database, password, host, username)
Use the SQLscript table to create tables in order to get the same column names as in the scripts
The scripts and SQLquerys in every step is run on the results from the previous step unless stated otherwise

Required perl-scripts:
artuppdelning.pl
turnright2.pl
export.pl
komplex_y2h_2.pl
gold_UNFformat.pl

Required SQL-scripts:
table
load
duplicates
create_MultSource
Delete_nondupl_entries

1. Johan

2. Put each set in a SQLtable with the SQLscript load
   Run artuppdelning.pl "tablename" "outfilename" on each table 
	The taxID in the SQLquery of the script must be changed depending on which organism you want to extract
   Merge the resultfiles into one SQLtable for each organism 

3. Export the SQLtables to tab-textfiles using export.pl "table" "outfilename"
   Run turnright2.pl "tablename" "corresponding tab-textfile"

4. Run the SQLscript duplicates to remove redundancy
	The script needs to modified to fit your tables and the name you want for the resulttable
   Remove all entries where pubmed = -, unassigned, doi

5. Run the SQLscript create_MultSource
	The in- and result-tables in the script needs to modified

6. Export the SQLtables to tab-textfiles
   Add fulltext index for column expMet to the tables
   Run komplex_y2h_2.pl "the tab_textfile" "outfilename"
	The table in the SQLquery of the script needs to be modified
   Put each resultfile in a SQLtable
   Remove the redundancy with the SQLscript duplicates
	Modify as above
   Remove single entries with the SQLscript Delete_nondupl_entries
	First create a temporary copy of the table 
	Modify the script according to the original and copy of the table
	Drop the temporary table

7. Run duplicates
	Change duplicates third line to "GROUP BY protA, protB"
	Modify as above
   Export the result table to tab-textfile
   Run gold_UNFformat.pl "the tab-texfile" "outfilename"
	The table in the SQLquery of the script needs to be modified to the resulttables from step 6 NOT the ones from 7

8. Export
